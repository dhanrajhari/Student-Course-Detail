The Project is about Power BI and Excel, I analyzed student data related to course durations, start and end dates, completion status, and other details. By integrating various data sources, I created insightful visualizations and reports to track the performance and progress of students across different departments and locations. The project involved cleaning and transforming the data to ensure accuracy, then presenting it in an user-friendly format for easy decision-making. Through Power BI, I generated interactive dashboards that highlighted trends in course completion and duration. Overall, this project provided valuable insights into student progress, aiding in better resource allocation and course management.
